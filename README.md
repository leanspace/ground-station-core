## Installation

Install `libpredict`:
```
git clone https://github.com/la1k/libpredict.git
cd libpredict
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
sudo make install
```

Install prerequisites
```
sudo apt-get install cmake gcc make predict libjson-c-dev hamlib-utils msmtp msmtp-mta
```

Configure msmtp

Install GSC:
```
git clone https://github.com/skypodolsky/isu_ground_station.git
cd isu_ground_station
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
sudo make install
```

GSC will download a list of active satellites.
It will also register a new cron task to update this list every five days.

## Launch

Start `rotctld` antenna controlling daemon(-s):

```
#azimuth controller
screen sudo rotctld -s 9600 -m 1004 -r /dev/ttyUSB0 -T 127.0.0.1 -t 8080 -vvvvv

#elevation controller
screen sudo rotctld -s 9600 -m 1005 -r /dev/ttyUSB1 -T 127.0.0.1 -t 8081 -vvvvv
```

Start GSC:
```
screen sudo ./gsc --verbosity 3 --remote-addr 127.0.0.1 --azimuth-port 8080 --elevation-port 8081 --request-port 25565 --latitude=48.31237 --longitude=7.44126
```

# Architecture

## Main software structure
The main concept of the GSC is based on core architecture, which means that all main features are provided by a functional core block, in which all interaction with other utilities is strictly defined. The architecture is portable, which means that it can be moved without almost any changes to other Unix-based platforms (f.e., Raspberry PI, Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, etc). The product is written in C and compiled with CMake, which makes its deployment easier on different Linux platforms.

The architecture consists primarily of the following subsystems:
 - Configuration server
 - JSON REST API
 - Configuration parser
 - Block for orbit prediction
 - Block for antenna handling
 - Block for SDR interaction
 - Block for scheduling satellites
 - Notification system

Antenna rotatorsâ€™ controllers are programmed by rotctld daemon. It is a part of Hamlib library, which is widely used as a software controlling unit for ground stations all around the world. It is a standard Linux-based utility that supports a lot of controllers of antenna rotators. Widely used for numerous prediction programs like GPredict, libpredict library for orbit prediction has found an application in this project too. For compatibility with all popular SDRs, SoapySDR library was chosen. It provides a hardware-independent C API for interaction, which is used to control an SDR. The system is configured from console (all static variables, f.e., latitude, longitude, azimuth offset compensation, etc.) and via network requests (dynamic configuration, f.e., tracking configuration). GSC uses a network server to make the second configuration type possible. To provide a reliable solution, libev library for network events handling has been integrated. Last but not least, libjson-c, a C-based library for parsing JSON requests, has also been chosen as a lightweight JSON parsing library.
